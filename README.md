# Spotify-Fullscreen
A simple Python program made to show a full screen interface of Spotify when it is playing on a desktop or another device. This is my first attempt at using QT5, more specifically PyQT5 and obviously making a GUI is not the simplest thing in the world. 

I have always wanted a way in which Spotify would cover the entire screen with the album art and some information about the music that it is currently playing and here is my attempt at it.

Anyone that stumbles upon my project, I hope you enjoy it as much as much I have enjoyed trying to my a proper GUI with QT5!

### TODO
- Fix the UI for adding the username, client id and the client secret so that it will save the information to the config.ini file
- Fix different monitor resolution resizing problems
- Improve the UI
    - Add a more elegant visual that contains the information about the track
    - Make the UI follow a Vertical Layout
    - Add a help menu with information about the hotkeys
- Add more options for Spotify playback control
    - Transfer playback to different devices
    - Control the volume of the current playing song
